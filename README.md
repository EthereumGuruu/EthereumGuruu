# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EthereumGuruu

When I first heard about Bitcoin, back in 2010, it was still very confusing to me. I mean, I get it:
if people agree that it has value, then it has value. But why would I agree with these people in the
idea that this thing has value. I already had to agree with a lot more people that dollars have value
and I was already not convinced. Still, the idea was very appealing and I wrote articles abou it. My
take at the time was: Bitcoin itself might be just a fad but blockchain technology is here to stay.

Ok clearly I was wrong. I'm not sure why though... I honestly still don't see the point of Bitcoin
especially now that we have all these objectively better blockchain networks.

When I heard about Ethereum in 2016 however, and learned about idea of deploying code to this distributed
computer and would be up forever. That I'll just have to pay some ETH for deployment and people would have
to pay some to interact, I immediately saw the value. Not only there was a concrete added value but also,
a strong incentive for owning ETH, since I'm gonna need a bunch if I want to deploy all my contracts and
interact with others.

Anyway... I just wanted to share that little piece of my mind, and maybe also brag about how old I am in
the space ðŸ˜„.

Now to be perfectly honest, I only started transitionning from web developer to smart contract developer 2
years later, when the ICO boom shot the price of Ethereum up 2000%
